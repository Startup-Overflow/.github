# Introduction
 
Startup Overflow is the one-stop solution for all business, startup, and entrepreneurship enthusiasts. On this platform, we aim to bring together already established entrepreneurs and budding entrepreneurs on the same page, so as to create a symbiotic space for them to flourish. Here budding entrepreneurs can learn from the experienced ones and seek guidance and knowledge on how to move ahead with their ideas and make a name for themselves in the industry. Startup Overflow will be a community where businesses and startups will be promoted in various ways. 

To name a few:

1. An open forum to ask questions and queries regarding a particular topic of interest, where anyone can answer be it another budding entrepreneur or an already established one(mentor). 
2. Mentors who choose to be a part of this community will be able to share their articles and content and receive feedback in the form of upvotes and downvotes. Other users can also share their content in the form of articles here. 
3. If content is unrelated to business our NLP model does not allow posting.
4. Entrepreneurs will also have the facility to receive investments for their innovations, as multiple investing agencies will also, be a part of Startup Overflow. 
4. After receiving mentorship and investment, entrepreneurs can also choose to hire personnel as startup partners for the large-scale production of their services. 
5. After taking mentorship users are given a form asking some questions, based on which, our NLP model rates the Mentors.
